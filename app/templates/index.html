				<h3>Information</h3>
				<p>This NSF funded research program focuses on technological
					innovations with potential for significant economic
					and societal impact. A pressing social and environmental
					issue on a national scale is the effect of
					stormwater on waterbody impairment, particularly in urban
					and suburban watersheds.
					Impairment is caused by stormwater runoff increasing stream
					volume and flow rates that result in
					hydromodification in streams, stream erosion and
					sedimentation, flooding, and overflows in
					combined sewer systems. In addition, stormwater diminishes
					water quality by adding pollutants (e.g.,
					solids, nutrients, metals) as it runs over land and into
					streams.
				</p>
				<p>To successfully reduce pollution, municipalities must adopt
					innovative technologies at all stages of implementation,
					operation, and maintenance. One approach utilizes stormwater
					green infrastructure (GI), such as
					bioretention, constructed wetlands, vegetated roofs, and
					cisterns. Green infrastructure reduces
					watershed runoff volume, decreases runoff discharge rates
					through the watershed, and promotes
					infiltration and evapotranspiration to better mimic an
					undeveloped hydrologic cycle and filter water
					quality pollutants. Green infrastructure is becoming the
					preferred method of stormwater
					management, not only for small parcels of land but entire
					municipalities. A number of cities across
					the U.S. (e.g., New York, Washington D.C., Omaha, Austin,
					Cincinnati, and Seattle) are turning to
					GI to mitigate stormwater pollution issues. Despite the
					promise of GI systems to effectively address
					stormwater issues, adoption has been slow due to several
					factors, which can be classified generally as
					technological and human.
				</p>
				<p>This project is an academic-industry research partnerships to
					address the central issue of identifying and advancing key
					platform technologies so as
					to enable “smart” service systems to enter into the
					commercialization process and to help insure
					positive social outcomes that would result from successful
					commercialization”, the proposal has the
					following goals:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li> Develop new monitoring and control algorithms
						integrated into a platform technology,
						OptiRTC, that automatically monitors and controls
						stormwater GI systems to:
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li> Optimize performance of GI systems for water
							quantity and quality
						</li>
						<li> Self-correct and maximize efficiency of GI
							systems
						</li>
						<li> Minimize operation and maintenance costs</li>
						<li> Integrate policy directly into design and
							operation
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li> Accelerate the implementation of state-of-the-art smart
						stormwater services to increase the
						potential applications and market value of OptiRTC and
						meet national, regional, and local policy and
						financing needs in stormwater management
					</li>
					<li> Enable synergistic activities to grow and develop
						academic and research faculty and the
						industry partner through interdisciplinary and
						cross-organizational collaboration and prepare
						graduate research students to become the next generation
						of professionals with an understanding of
						technology enterprise
					</li>
					<li> Incite innovation in secondary markets</li>
					<li> Encourage GI implementation across scales as the
						benefits become clearer
					</li>
					<ul>
